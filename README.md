Hi, I'm Jeff! I am a full time CS student who dables in low level systems, specifically with Unix. If you would like to contact me, discord will be the quickest and easiest way. My discord is just jeffofbread. If you specifically have an issue with a particular repo or project I have, please post an issue or discussion on that project instead of directly messaging me.
